My name is Esmaeil Farhang, I graduated in AI from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran. My thesis title was <font color="green">"Effect of Spatial frequency content on the hierarchical object recognition"</font> under the supervision of Dr. Abolghasemi Dehaghani. I received my B.Sc. degree in mathematics in 2016 from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran.  

My main research interests are in <font color="green"> deep learning, machine learning, data science, and application of AI in medicine and related fields</font>. During my education period, I did a variety of projects for different courses and research in machine learning, which helped me to learn research and scientific proficiency. As a side-work, I have been working as a Machine Learning R&D Engineer on some industrial and research projects such as converting Text-To-Speech(TTS), face anti-spoofing, head pose estimation, face depth estimation, and face emotion detection. All these topics included many challenging problems to solve. I am pleased to apply my knowledge in both research and industry and improved my technical and analytical skills. 

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the University of Tehran Cognitive Systems Lab.

<!-- I will be a senior from department of ECE at the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran. I received my B.Sc. degree in 2016 from the Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran. Since September 2017, I started my Master's program under the supervision of Dr. Abolghasemi Dehaghani. 

My main research interests in the <font color="green"> system and computational neuroscience, deep learning, and  machine learning.</font> As a side-work, I have been a member of HiBrainy working on some industrial projects including (TTS)Text-To-Speech, face anti-spoofing, liveness detection, head pose estimation, face depth estimation, and face emotion detection. 

All these topics include many challenging problems to solve and I'm really happy to use my learning knowledge in both research and industry. Currently, I am Research Assistant at the University of Tehran Cognitive Systems Lab. -->
