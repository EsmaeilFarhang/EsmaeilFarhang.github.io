I am a third year M.Sc. student at the department of ECE at the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran. I received my B.Sc. degree in 2016 from the Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran. Since September 2017, I started my Master's program under the supervision of Dr. MohammadReza abolghasemi dehaghani. My main research interests in system neuroscience and machine learning. As a side-work, I have been a member of HiBrainy working on some industrial projects including Text-To-Speech, face anti-spoofing, liveness detection, head pose estimation, face depth estimation, and face emotion detection. All these topics include many uncertainty factors and challenging problems to solve and I'm really happy with what I do in both research and industry. Currently, I am Research Assistant at the University of Tehran Cognitive Systems Lab.
