I will be a senior from department of ECE at the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran. I received my B.Sc. degree in 2016 from the Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran. Since September 2017, I started my Master's program under the supervision of Dr. Abolghasemi Dehaghani. 

My main research interests in the <font color="green"> system and computational neuroscience, deep learning, and  machine learning.</font> As a side-work, I have been a member of HiBrainy working on some industrial projects including (TTS)Text-To-Speech, face anti-spoofing, liveness detection, head pose estimation, face depth estimation, and face emotion detection. 

All these topics include many challenging problems to solve and I'm really happy to use my learning knowledge in both research and industry. Currently, I am Research Assistant at the University of Tehran Cognitive Systems Lab.
